# INTRODUCTION​

Our research is about building a smart system to manage cattle using Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This system helps farmers keep track of their cattle easily and improves farm productivity. It uses real-time data to monitor growth, predict milk production, and check the location and health of the cattle. The system also finds diseases and pests early, keeping the animals healthier. By using these advanced technologies, we make farming simpler and more reliable. This helps farmers make better choices and run their farms in a sustainable way.​

# Research Problem

Disease Identification, Breed Analysis, GPS Tracking, Growth Monitoring and Milk Future Prediction in farms require various equipment and it takes a lot of time and money. As a solution to this, we use one device to perform all these tasks. This saves the cost, time and money of different devices. It increases the efficiency of firms.​
