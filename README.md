# INTRODUCTION​

Our research is about building a smart system to manage cattle using Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This system helps farmers keep track of their cattle easily and improves farm productivity. It uses real-time data to monitor growth, predict milk production, and check the location and health of the cattle. The system also finds diseases and pests early, keeping the animals healthier. By using these advanced technologies, we make farming simpler and more reliable. This helps farmers make better choices and run their farms in a sustainable way.​

# Research Problem

Disease Identification, Breed Analysis, GPS Tracking, Growth Monitoring and Milk Future Prediction in farms require various equipment and it takes a lot of time and money. As a solution to this, we use one device to perform all these tasks. This saves the cost, time and money of different devices. It increases the efficiency of firms.​

# Our Components​

1. Automated Breed Identification and Management System for Cattle​
2. Monitoring Cattle Growth and Milk Recording and future prediction​
3. Integrated Cattle Tracking, Health and ​Feeding Pattern​
4. Pests and Diseases Identification​

# Overall Project Objectives

## Objectives :-
1.Quick Disease Identification: Develop methods to quicly identify diseases in cattle.
2.Breed Analysis: Analyze different cattle breeds and their traits.
3.GPS Tracking: Implement GPS technology to track cattle locations.
4.Growth and Health Monitoring: Monitor the growth and health of cattle.
5.Milk Production Prediction: Predict future milk production.

## Sub Objectives :-
1.Developing algorithms to detect early signs of diseases in cattle.
2.Creating a database to store and analyze breed characteristics.
3.Implementing GPS tracking for real-time location monitoring.
4.Designing tools to monitor cattle growth and health metrics.
